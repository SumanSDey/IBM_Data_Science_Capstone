Hi!

This repository contains the real world project I did during my certification program: "IBM Data Science Professional Certificate"

The name of the project & some format is, however, same for all learners but the technical work from raw data handling till
model deployment is the product of one's own knowledge.
By same name of project & some format, what I mean is IBM had given a format for the presentation creation which, I believe,
was indeed a great step taken to reduce redundant works that shouldn't be priority right now. It is a priority as we go on working
on further projects as the main aim, of all the hard work put in by a Data Scientist/Data Analyst from the very beginning till
visualization, is to make the whole picture visible & easy to the extent that the only thing standing between the "decision makers"
& the "scenario the data represents and needs action on" is the "decision" they make & NOT a "technical factor".
